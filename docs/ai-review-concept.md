## üìù Core Features (Diary Flow)

### Daily Record Submission

- Users log what they did each day
- AI automatically summarizes and refines the entry upon submission

### User Overview Page

- AI generates an overview of all past entries
- Analyzes goals, strengths, and areas for improvement

### Time-Period Summary

- Users can select a period (week, month, custom range)
- AI provides a summary of entries within that period

---

## üîç Analysis & Insights

### Trend Analysis

- Highlight changes in focus over time (e.g., more collaboration tasks, fewer study notes)

### Keyword Cloud

- Visualize frequently mentioned keywords to show areas of focus

---

## üéØ Goal Management (Period-Based System)

### Problem & Solution

**Problem:** Users have vague long-term goals but can't track if their daily work actually progresses toward them. Example: Goal is "Learn React" but spending all time on PHP legacy code.

**Solution:** Period-based goal system with AI analysis showing "goals vs. reality" gap.

### Core Features

**Multiple Goals Per Period:**

- Users can set multiple daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly goals simultaneously
- No artificial limits - track as many goals as needed

**Flexible Management:**

- Edit goal titles while they're active
- Mark goals as COMPLETED when achieved
- REACTIVATE completed goals back to ACTIVE status
- Delete goals permanently with confirmation

**Auto-Calculated Deadlines:**

- DAILY: Today at 23:59:59
- WEEKLY: End of current week (Sunday)
- MONTHLY: Last day of current month
- QUARTERLY: Last day of current quarter
- YEARLY: December 31st

### UI Location

**Story Page** - Goals section above AI analysis (collapsible)

- Set goals ‚Üí review progress in one flow
- AI analysis references your goals in context

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Concept: Story Period vs Goal Period

**Story Period** (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly):

- Determines **which posts** are analyzed (e.g., "daily" = past 24 hours of posts)
- Does **NOT** filter which goals are checked

**Goal Period** (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, YEARLY):

- Defines the goal's deadline/duration
- Only active goals are checked regardless of story period (completed goals are not analyzed)

**Example:**

- User generates "Past 24 Hours" review (daily story)
- AI analyzes: Posts from past 24 hours
- AI checks: **ALL ACTIVE goals** (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- AI evaluates: "Did today's activities contribute to ANY of your active goals?"

**Rationale:**

- A single day's work can contribute to multiple active goals with different time horizons
- Progress on a monthly goal should be recognized even in daily reviews
- Users should see holistic progress tracking, not siloed by period
- Completed goals are not analyzed to reduce context volume and keep focus on current objectives

### AI Integration & Analysis

AI story analyzes posts against active goals only:

```
üéØ Goal vs Reality
- Weekly "Ship auth system": 8 posts - ‚úÖ Strong progress
- Monthly "Learn React hooks": 2 posts - ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs focus
- Quarterly "System design study": 0 posts - ‚ùå Neglected

üèÜ Key Achievements
- Shipped authentication flow
- Completed 3 code reviews

‚ö†Ô∏è Gap Analysis
- 70% time on auth system (aligned with weekly goal)
- React learning stalled - schedule dedicated sessions
- System design completely ignored - carve out time

üí° Next Actions
- Block 2h daily for React study
- Start with system design fundamentals
```

### Story Caching & Freshness

**Default Behavior:**

- When visiting story page without query parameter ‚Üí Automatically fetch 'all' period story
- Applies to both owner view (StoryGenerator) and visitor view (UserStoryViewer)
- Ensures users always see content immediately without manual period selection

**User Flow:**

1. User clicks period button ‚Üí Check for cached story
2. If cached story exists ‚Üí Load immediately and check if outdated
3. If no cached story ‚Üí Show "Generate Story?" confirmation prompt
4. User clicks "Generate Story" ‚Üí Actually generate with AI

**Outdated Story Detection:**

Stories are marked as outdated when they're older than the period they represent:

| Period                | Outdated After | Warning Shown |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Past 24 Hours (daily) | > 1 day old    | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| Past Week (weekly)    | > 7 days old   | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| Past Month (monthly)  | > 30 days old  | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| Past Year (yearly)    | > 365 days old | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| Entire Journey (all)  | Never outdated | ‚ùå No         |

**Rationale:**

- Outdated stories still shown (not hidden) with small warning text
- Users can click "Regenerate" to get fresh analysis
- "Entire Journey" never marked outdated (too expensive to regenerate frequently)
- Warning: "‚ö†Ô∏è This story is outdated. Recent posts and goals aren't included."

### Goal Schema

```typescript
model Goal {
  id          String      @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  title       String
  period      GoalPeriod  // DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, YEARLY
  startDate   DateTime    @default(now())
  deadline    DateTime
  status      GoalStatus  // ACTIVE, COMPLETED
  completedAt DateTime?

  // No unique constraint - multiple goals per period allowed
}
```
