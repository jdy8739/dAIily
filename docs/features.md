---

## üéØ Goal Management (Period-Based System)

### Problem & Solution

**Problem:** Users have vague long-term goals but can't track if their daily work actually progresses toward them. Example: Goal is "Learn React" but spending all time on PHP legacy code.

**Solution:** Period-based goal system with AI analysis showing "goals vs. reality" gap.

### Core Features

**Multiple Goals Per Period:**
- Users can set multiple daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly goals simultaneously
- No artificial limits - track as many goals as needed

**Flexible Management:**
- Edit goal titles while they're active
- Mark goals as COMPLETED or ABANDONED
- REACTIVATE completed goals back to ACTIVE status
- Goals remain in system for historical tracking

**Auto-Calculated Deadlines:**
- DAILY: Today at 23:59:59
- WEEKLY: End of current week (Sunday)
- MONTHLY: Last day of current month
- QUARTERLY: Last day of current quarter
- YEARLY: December 31st

### UI Locations

**Story Page** - Goals section above AI analysis (collapsible)
- Set goals ‚Üí review progress in one flow
- AI analysis references your goals in context

**Feed Sidebar** - Show active goals for motivation
- Always visible while browsing feed
- Quick motivation and progress awareness

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Concept: Story Period vs Goal Period

**Story Period** (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly):
- Determines **which posts** are analyzed (e.g., "daily" = past 24 hours of posts)
- Does **NOT** filter which goals are checked

**Goal Period** (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, YEARLY):
- Defines the goal's deadline/duration
- All active and completed goals are checked regardless of story period

**Example:**
- User generates "Past 24 Hours" review (daily story)
- AI analyzes: Posts from past 24 hours
- AI checks: **ALL goals** (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- AI evaluates: "Did today's activities contribute to ANY of your goals?"

**Rationale:**
- A single day's work can contribute to multiple goals with different time horizons
- Progress on a monthly goal should be recognized even in daily reviews
- Users should see holistic progress tracking, not siloed by period

### AI Integration & Analysis

AI story analyzes posts against all goals with clear status indicators:

```
üéØ Goal vs Reality
- [ACTIVE] Weekly "Ship auth system": 8 posts - ‚úÖ Strong progress
- [COMPLETED] Daily "Review PRs": Finished! ‚ú®
- [ACTIVE] Monthly "Learn React hooks": 2 posts - ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs focus
- [ACTIVE] Quarterly "System design study": 0 posts - ‚ùå Neglected

üèÜ Achievements
- Completed daily PR review goal on time
- Strong momentum on weekly shipping goal

‚ö†Ô∏è Gap Analysis
- 70% time on auth system (aligned with weekly goal)
- React learning stalled - schedule dedicated sessions
- System design completely ignored - carve out time
```

### Goal Schema

```typescript
model Goal {
  id          String      @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  title       String
  period      GoalPeriod  // DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, YEARLY
  startDate   DateTime    @default(now())
  deadline    DateTime
  status      GoalStatus  // ACTIVE, COMPLETED, ABANDONED
  completedAt DateTime?

  // No unique constraint - multiple goals per period allowed
}
```
